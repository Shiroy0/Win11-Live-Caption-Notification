# Win11-Live-Caption-Notification
To ignore (auto-close) the annoying "Captions are being missed" notification/warning in the Live Caption app of Windows 11.

Just run exe in the background, or you could run ahk file if you have AutoHotkey installed. Maybe you could also put the file in the startup.
